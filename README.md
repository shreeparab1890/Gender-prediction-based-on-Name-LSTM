# Gender prediction based on Name LSTM
This ipython notebook is working to build a model which will predict the gender based on the names. 
The dataset used has been taken from:  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrikrishnaparab/gender-based-names">Kaggle: Gender Based Names</a>  
You can follow the analysis on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/shrikrishnaparab/gender-prediction-based-on-name-using-lstm">kaggle</a>
 
## Deployment:
Streamlit is used to build a front-end for the Gender prediction app and is deployed on huggingface.co.
