# Gender prediction based on Name LSTM
This ipython notebook is working to build a model which will predict the gender based on the names. 
The dataset used has been taken from:  <a href="https://gist.github.com/mbejda/7f86ca901fe41bc14a63">Male Names</a>  
<a href="https://gist.github.com/mbejda/9b93c7545c9dd93060bd">Female Names</a>
